## Basic Arithmetic

Programs in this section cover basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## If-Else Statements

These programs demonstrate the use of if-else statements to make decisions in your code based on different conditions.

## For Loops

Here, you'll find programs that use for loops to iterate over sequences and perform repeated actions.

## While Loops

This section contains programs that utilize while loops for repetitive tasks, running as long as a certain condition remains true.

## Lists

Programs in this category show how to work with lists, including creating, accessing, and modifying list elements.

## Tuples

Learn how to use tuples in Python through these example programs, demonstrating their immutability and how to perform various operations on them.

## Dictionaries

Explore the use of dictionaries in Python with programs that demonstrate how to create, access, and manipulate key-value pairs.

## Patterns

This section includes programs that generate various patterns using loops, which is a common exercise to understand nested loops and iteration.

## Sum of Series

Programs here calculate the sum of different mathematical series, demonstrating the use of loops and arithmetic operations to solve problems.

## Getting Started

To run any of these programs, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
